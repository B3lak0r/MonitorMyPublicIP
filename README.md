# MonitorMyPublicIP

This repository contains code for a workflow that performs a daily `nmap` scan for open ports on a target (specified by the `IP_ADDRESS` Github secret) and exports the results into an issue on this repository.

Any IP addresses in the results have been intentionally censored for privacy reasons.
